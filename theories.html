  <h2>1. Don Norman – Model of Interaction</h2>
  <p>
    Don Norman is a cognitive scientist who studied how people think and behave when using interactive systems.
    His model explains interaction as a cycle between the user and the system.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    Norman’s model is mainly used to explain:
    why users get confused, why errors happen, and how design can reduce these problems.
  </p>

  <h3>The Seven Stages of Action</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Forming the goal</li>
    <li>Forming the intention</li>
    <li>Specifying the action</li>
    <li>Executing the action</li>
    <li>Perceiving the system state</li>
    <li>Interpreting the system state</li>
    <li>Evaluating the outcome</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Gulf of Execution</h3>
  <p>
    The Gulf of Execution is the gap between what the user wants to do and what actions the system allows or makes visible.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    Example:  
    A user wants to turn Wi-Fi ON, but the icon is hidden in a confusing menu.
    The goal is clear, but the user doesn’t know how to do it.
  </p>

  <h3>Gulf of Evaluation</h3>
  <p>
    The Gulf of Evaluation is the gap between what the system does and how well the user understands it.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    Example:  
    The user clicks “Submit” on a form, but nothing changes on the screen.
    The system gives no feedback, so the user doesn’t know if it worked.

  <h2>2. GOMS Model (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection Rules)</h2>

  <p>
    The GOMS model was proposed by Card, Moran, and Newell.
    It explains how an expert user performs a task after learning is complete.
    It is a task-analysis model that describes structured task performance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goals:</strong> What the user wants to achieve</li>
    <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Basic actions (click, type, move mouse)</li>
    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Step-by-step procedures to achieve a goal</li>
    <li><strong>Selection Rules:</strong> Rules for choosing between methods</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="highlight">
    Example:  
    Goal: Withdraw cash  
    Method: Insert card → Enter PIN → Select Withdraw → Enter amount  
    Operators: Insert card, press keys  
    Selection Rule: If ATM is nearby → use ATM
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    GOMS assumes correct behavior. It does NOT model:
    confusion, learning, feedback, or errors.

<section>
  <h2>3. Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h2>

  <p>
    KLM is a simplified, quantitative version of GOMS.
    It predicts how long a task will take for an expert user.
  </p>

  <h3>KLM Operators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>K</strong> – Keystroke or tap</li>
    <li><strong>P</strong> – Pointing to a target</li>
    <li><strong>H</strong> – Homing (move hand between devices)</li>
    <li><strong>M</strong> – Mental preparation</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> – System response time</li>
    <li><strong>B</strong> – Mouse button press</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="highlight">
    Example (ATM PIN entry):  
    [M] think → [P] move finger → [K] press key
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    KLM assumes:
    expert users, no errors, and no need for feedback.
