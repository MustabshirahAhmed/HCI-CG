  <h2>Don Norman – Norman’s Model of Interaction</h2>
  <p>
    Don Norman is a cognitive scientist who focused on understanding how people think and behave while using interactive systems.
    His model explains user interaction in terms of goals, actions, feedback, and evaluation.
    The main purpose of Norman’s model is to explain why users get confused, why errors occur, and how good design can reduce these problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Norman’s work is especially important for understanding usability, user errors, and feedback in interface design.

  <h2>Card, Moran & Newell – GOMS and KLM</h2>
  <p>
    Card, Moran, and Newell proposed the GOMS model and the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM).
    Their work focuses on expert users who already know how to use a system.
    These models are used to analyze task performance, efficiency, and time taken to complete tasks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike Norman’s model, GOMS and KLM do not focus on confusion, feedback, or learning.
