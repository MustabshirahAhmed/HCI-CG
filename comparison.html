          <td>Goal</td>
          <td>User forms a clear goal: “I need Rs. 5000 cash for immediate use.”</td>
          <td>GOAL: Withdraw cash.<br>This is the top-level objective defined before any action starts.</td>
          <td>Not modeled. KLM assumes the goal is already fixed.</td>
          <td>Direct Match – Norman’s Goal corresponds exactly to GOMS Goal.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="match">
          <td>Plan / Intention</td>
          <td>User decides: “I’ll use the ATM nearby instead of going inside the bank.”</td>
          <td>METHOD: ATM withdrawal method.<br>Selection Rule: Choose ATM because it is faster and convenient.</td>
          <td>Not modeled. KLM does not represent planning decisions.</td>
          <td>Strong Match – Norman’s planning maps to GOMS Method and Selection Rule.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="partial">
          <td>Specify</td>
          <td>User mentally plans the steps: insert card → enter PIN → select withdrawal → enter amount.</td>
          <td>Assumed to be already defined inside the chosen method. No explicit cognitive step is shown.</td>
          <td>May involve a Mental operator [M], but only as preparation, not detailed reasoning.</td>
          <td>Partial Match – Norman explicitly models thinking; GOMS and KLM largely abstract it.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="match">
          <td>Execute</td>
          <td>User physically inserts card, types PIN, presses screen buttons.</td>
          <td>OPERATORS: Key presses, button selections, card insertion.</td>
          <td>[M][P][K] sequence: [M] prepare → [P] point → [K] press.</td>
          <td>Direct Match – All three models represent physical execution clearly.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="nomatch">
          <td>Perceive</td>
          <td>User sees screen message “Processing…” and hears ATM sounds.</td>
          <td>Not modeled. Correct perception is assumed.</td>
          <td>Not modeled. No perception stage exists.</td>
          <td>Major Difference – Only Norman explicitly includes perception.</td>

          <td>Interpret</td>

          <td>Evaluate</td>
          <td>Cash is dispensed; user checks amount and confirms goal is achieved.</td>
          <td>Task is assumed complete once operators finish successfully.</td>
          <td>Task ends when last operator finishes; no evaluation.</td>
          <td>Key Difference – Only Norman checks whether the goal was truly achieved.</td>
